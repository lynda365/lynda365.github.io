title:  "Flaky Pastry Double Crust"
image: flaky-pastry.jpg
tags: basic

ingredients:
- 325g plain flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 230g butter (use Stork to make vegan)
- 4-8 tbsp iced water

directions:
- Mix 195g of the flour with salt and sugar. Add butter, cut into cubes. Rub flour and butter together to make a breadcrumby mixture. Add the remaining 130g of flour and mix together lightly (dough should look crumbly with pea-sized pieces).
- Sprinkle ice water over the mixture — start with 4 tablespoons and add from there. Using a rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of the dough and it holds together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and continue to press until dough comes together.
- Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball. Cut ball in proportions 3:5 top/bottom then form each part into discs. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using).
- Roll out bottom of pastry into circle and press into a greased and floured quiche tin. Fold top edge of dough to create thicker rim.
- Fill with pie filling. Brush rim with water or milk. Roll out second piece of dough, place on top and crimp edges. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes or freeze for 5 minutes.
- Heat oven to 200C (fan) with a baking tray in the middle. Just before baking, glaze with egg wash or plant milk/maple syrup and sprinkle with 1 tbsp sugar. Cut 3 to 4 slits to let out steam.
- Bake 20 to 30 minutes or according to pie recipe.

comments: 
- Use the 4cm deep, 25cm diameter fluted quiche tin with removable base.
