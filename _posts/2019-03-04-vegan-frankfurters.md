ingredients:
- 400g firm tofu
- 150g onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- water to make 100ml
- 5 tbsp vegetable oil
- 50g sesame seeds, ground
- 2 tbsp smoked paprika
- 3 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 2 tsp ground mustard
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp ground cardamom
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- ---
- 2 tsp cornflour
- 225g vital wheat gluten

directions:
- Crumble tofu into bowl of blender.
- In a liquid measuring cup, measure the soy sauce and add water to make 100ml. Add to blender and blend.
- Gradually add all other ingredients except cornflour and gluten, blending as you go. Pour into a large mixing bowl.
- Add vital wheat gluten and cornflour to the mixture and stir to combine. Knead gently - the mixture will be soft but you'll see strands of gluten forming.
- Divide the dough into equal pieces of 75g. Roll each into a rough hot dog shape (doesn't have to be perfect). Wrap each dog in clingfilm and twist the ends shut.
- Steam for approx 45 mins.
- Allow to cool before unwrapping.
- They can be fried, grilled, or added to stews.

comments: 
- makes approx 14 hot dogs at 75g each.
- They keep well in the freezer.
