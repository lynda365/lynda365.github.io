ingredients: 
- 100g creamed coconut
- 0.5 tbsp lemon juice
- 30g icing sugar
- 30ml oat milk

- 170ml jar coconut oil, melted
- 200g light brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 140ml dairy free milk, we used oat milk
- 280g plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2/3 tsp cinnamon, plus extra cinnamon to decorate
- 2/3 tsp ginger
- 2/3 tsp ground nutmeg
- 50g caster sugar
- 2 oranges, zest only
- 3 medium carrots, grated (you want 200g grated weight)
- 50g chopped walnuts, plus extra to decorate

directions: 
- Start by making the icing first. Mash the coconut cream with 2 tbsp hot water and the lemon juice until smooth.Whisk in the icing sugar followed by the oat milk. Continue to whisk until fully combined, set aside in the fridge until needed.
- Place 50g caster sugar and 50ml water in a small saucepan. Bring to boil and simmer a few mins. Add the grated zest of 1 orange and leave to cool. 
- Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas mark 4. Grease 2lb loaf tin with a little of the melted coconut oil and line the bases with baking parchment. Whisk together the oil and sugar, then add the vanilla and milk. Combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, spices and zest of the other orange in a separate bowl. Add these to the wet mixture and stir well. Finally stir in the carrot and the nuts. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out cleanly. Cool in the tin for 5 mins before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
- Spread icing on top of the cake and decorate with glazed orange zest.
