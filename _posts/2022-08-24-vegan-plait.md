- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to taste
- 1 x 400g tin lentils or beans, drained
- 1-2 tbsp tomato puree
- 35g olives, chopped
- 35g sundried tomatoes in oil, chopped

- 500g pack jus-rol puff pastry
- plant milk and maple syrup (3:1) for glaze

directions:
- Slice and saute the mushrooms (if using).
- Finely chop onion (and carrot) and saute gently in oil for 10-15 mins.
- Mix everything together in a bowl and set aside.
- Heat oven to 200C.
- For plait, roll out pastry to approx 30cm x 30cm. Shape the mixture into a sausage down the middle third. Make diagonal incisions each side of the pastry and plait together, using plant milk to seal. It can be kept in the fridge or frozen at this point. To cook, brush with the glaze mixture, place on a greased and floured baking tray, and bake for 25-30 mins.
- For sausage rolls, roll out pastry to approx 35cm x 25cm. Cut in 2 lengthwise. Shape the mixture into 2 sausages lengthwise down the centre of each piece. Roll into two long sausages, sealing with plant milk. Chill for 20 mins. Cut diagonal slashes along the top of each sausage, then cut each sausage into 4 or 8 pieces. It can be kept in the fridge or frozen at this point. To cook, brush with the glaze mixture, place on a greased and floured baking tray, and bake for 20-25 mins.

- Filling should be 500-600g weight for plait.
