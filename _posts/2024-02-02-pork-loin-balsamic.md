tags: pork main

ingredients: 
- 900g pork, loin joint, raw, lean and fat
- 2g thyme, fresh
- 2g rosemary, fresh
- 1 tbsp oil, olive
- 250ml vinegar, balsamic
- 56g (8 cloves) garlic, raw

directions: 
- Chop the thyme and rosemary. Peel and halve the garlic cloves.
- Remove the skin from the pork and score with a sharp knife for the crackling.
- Heat oven to 180C/170C fan.
- Rub the meat and the fat side of the skin with olive oil, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. Brown the skin, fat side down, in a frying pan. Take out and set aside. Brown the meat in the same frying pan, turning occasionally, for about 5 mins. Add the balsamic vinegar and bubble. Place meat in roasting tray. Pour over the balsamic vinegar and add the garlic. Put the roasting tray in the oven, with the pork skin directly on the oven rack above it, fat side down. Cook for 60 mins, keeping an eye on the crackling.
- When done, rest pork for 10 mins. Separate any fat from the gravy and store in a jar in fridge for future use. Thicken or add to the gravy as desired. Squish the garlic into it through a sieve.
