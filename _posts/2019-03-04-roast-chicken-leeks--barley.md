tags: chicken main

ingredients:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 500g leeks, sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 scotch bonnet chilli, finely chopped
- 300g pearl barley
- 600ml hot chicken stock
- 1 lemon, zest of whole and juice of half
- 40g dried apples, finely chopped
- sprig of thyme
- pinch of star anise
- salt and pepper
- ---
- 1 large chicken (1.75 to 2.0kg)
- 25g butter

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 210C/200C Fan/Gas 6-7.
- Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat. Sizzle the garlic and chilli briefly, then add the leeks. Fry gently for about 10 minutes until soft. Add the pearl barley and stir well. 
- Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the grain is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed,about 45 minutes.
- Remove from the heat and stir in the chopped dried apples, lemon zest and juice, thyme, star anise, salt and pepper. Set aside in the warm pan.
- Prepare the chicken while the barley is cooking. Untruss and trim fat. Insert sliced lemon into cavity (the other half). Cut the butter into two sticks and insert under breast skin. Season and place in roasting tray with a little oil underneath to stop it sticking.
- Cover in foil and roast for 1 hour.
- Remove foil and baste the chicken, then tip the barley mixture into the tray around it. Add a little more hot water. Roast for a further half hour or more depending on the weight of the chicken.
- When the chicken is cooked, remove from tray and cover with foil. Allow to rest for up to half an hour while you steam some vegetables.

comments: 
- Remove the chicken from the fridge about an hour before cooking so it comes up to room temperature.
- Serves 6 or two over three meals.
- When eating cold, add a tin of tomatoes to the barley mixture and warm up.
