title:  "Pumpkin and Peanut Curry"
image: pumpkin-peanut-curry.jpg
tags: vegan main

ingredients:
- 100g raw peanuts, roasted, skinned and crushed (or use crunchy peanut butter)
- 1 tbsp tomato purée
- Zest and juice of 1 lime
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- ---
- Small handful fresh coriander, with roots (if possible)
- 2 red chillies, halved and deseeded
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1cm piece fresh ginger
- ---
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 red onions, cut into thin wedges
- 800g pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and roughly diced
- 400ml can coconut milk

directions:
- Stir the crushed peanuts into a jug containing 100ml hot water. Stir in the purée, lime zest and juice, soy or fish sauce and sugar. Set aside.
- Remove the leaves from the coriander and set aside. Chop the stalks and roots as finely as you can, along with the chilli, garlic and ginger.
- Heat the oil in a wok or good-sized pan and fry the onions quite briskly for a few minutes, so that they catch slightly. As soon as this starts to happen, add the pumpkin and stir-fry for a few minutes. Stir in the chilli mixture for 1 minute, then add the coconut milk. Stir, then add the peanut mix. Cook at a brisk simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly and the pumpkin is tender. Season to taste or add more soy or fish sauce, as you like. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with cooked rice.
