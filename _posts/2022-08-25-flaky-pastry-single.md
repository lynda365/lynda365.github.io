title:  "Flaky Pastry Single Crust"
image: flaky-pastry.jpg
tags: basic

ingredients:
- 205g plain flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 145g butter (use Stork to make vegan)
- 3-5 tbsp iced water

directions:
- Mix 130g of the flour with salt and sugar. Add butter, cut into cubes. Rub flour and butter together to make a breadcrumby mixture. Add the remaining 75g of flour and mix together lightly (dough should look crumbly with pea-sized pieces).
- Sprinkle ice water over the mixture — start with 3 tablespoons and add from there. Using a rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of the dough and it holds together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 1-2 more tablespoon of water and continue to press until dough comes together.
- Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball, then shape into a disc. Wrap disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using).
- Roll out pastry into circle and press into a greased and floured quiche tin. Pierce the bottom with a fork to prevent air bubbles. Add parchment and baking beads. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or freeze for 10 minutes.
- Heat oven to 200C (fan) with a baking tray in the middle.
- Place pie crust onto preheated baking sheet and reduce oven temperature to 180C. Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until the crust is golden. Remove baking beads, brush with egg wash or plant milk, then bake another 5 mins. Cool completely before adding filling.

comments: 
- This is for pre-baked case. If part-baking, follow directions for the recipe you are making.
- Use the 4cm deep, 25cm diameter fluted quiche tin with removable base.
