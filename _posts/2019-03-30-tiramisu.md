tags: dessert

ingredients:
- 4 eggs, separated
- 75g caster sugar
- 450g mascarpone
- 2 tbsp sweet marsala
- 2 tbsp dark rum
- 100ml espresso
- About 16-24 savoiardi biscuits (or boudoir, if unavailable), depending on size of dish
- Cocoa powder, to dust

directions:
- Whisk three of the egg whites until stiff, then set aside. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and voluminous, then whisk in the mascarpone, a little at a time, until smooth and well combined – you don't want lumps of cheese. Gently fold the three whites into the mascarpone mixture with a large metal spoon, being careful to knock as little air out as possible.
- Stir the booze into the coffee and pour into a shallow dish. Dip each biscuit into the liquid until it is a pale coffee colour, then arrange to cover the base of a shallow glass dish. Spoon a third of the mascarpone mixture on top, followed by a good sprinkle of cocoa, then repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of the cheese and cocoa.
- Cover and refrigerate for six hours before serving – you may need to dust with a little more cocoa to make it look respectable.

comments: 
- Serves 6.
