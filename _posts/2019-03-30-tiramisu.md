tags: dessert

ingredients:
- 4 eggs, separated
- 75g caster sugar
- 450g mascarpone
- 3 tbsp sweet marsala
- 3 tbsp dark rum
- 150ml espresso (6 scoops to 250ml water)
- 32-48 sponge fingers (1.5 packs Tesco, 200g, but Lidl fingers are larger)
- Cocoa powder, to dust

directions:
- Whisk three of the egg whites until stiff, then set aside. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and voluminous, then whisk in the mascarpone, a little at a time, until smooth and well combined – you don't want lumps of cheese. Gently fold the three whites into the mascarpone mixture with a large metal spoon, being careful to knock as little air out as possible.
- Stir the booze into the coffee and pour into a large shallow dish. Dip each biscuit into the liquid until it is a pale coffee colour, then arrange to cover the base of a shallow glass dish. Spoon a third of the mascarpone mixture on top, followed by a good sprinkle of cocoa, then repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of the cheese and cocoa.
- Cover and refrigerate for six hours before serving – you may need to dust with a little more cocoa to make it look respectable.

comments: 
- Serves 6-8.
