title:  "Cinnamon Rolls"
image: cinnamon-rolls.jpg
tags: vegan cake

ingredients:
- 50g vegan butter
- 2.75 tsp rapid-rise yeast
- 310ml unsweetened plain almond milk
- 1.5 tbsp sugar
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 450g unbleached all-purpose flour
- ---
- 50g vegan butter, melted
- 60g caster sugar
- 3.5 tsp ground cinnamon (to taste)
- ---
- 35g vegan butter, melted
- ---
- 100g icing sugar
- 1-2 tbsp almond milk

directions:
- In a large saucepan, heat the almond milk and vegan butter until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat and let cool to 43C or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
- Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes. Then add the sugar and the salt and stir.
- Next add in flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring as you go. The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball (be careful not to overmix). Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with oil, and add your dough ball back in. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. Brush with melted vegan butter and top with sugar and desired amount of cinnamon.
- Starting at one end, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough into 1.5 - 2 inch sections and position in a well-buttered 8x8 inch square or comparable sized round pan. 
- Brush with vegan butter (melted) and cover with plastic wrap. Rise again in a warm place until the size you want. Preheat oven to 175 C.
- Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes and then serve immediately.
- Frost with a mixture of icing sugar and 1-2 Tbsp almond milk.

comments:
