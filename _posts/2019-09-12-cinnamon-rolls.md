image: cinnamon-rolls.jpg
tags: vegan cake

ingredients:
- 50g vegan butter
- 2.75 tsp rapid-rise yeast
- 310ml unsweetened plain almond milk
- 1.5 tbsp sugar
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 225g plain flour
- 225g strong bread flour
- ---
- 50g vegan butter, melted
- 60g caster sugar
- 3.5 tsp ground cinnamon (to taste)
- ---
- 35g vegan butter, melted
- ---
- Sugar/water glaze
- 100g icing sugar
- 1-2 tbsp almond milk

directions:
- In a large saucepan, heat the almond milk and vegan butter until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat, stir in 1tsp sugar and let cool to 43C or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
- Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes. Then add the rest of the sugar and the salt and stir.
- Next add in flour 1/2 cup at a time, stirring as you go. The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with oil, and add your dough ball back in. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
- Knock back dough, form into rectangle. Wrap in clingfilm and leave in refrigerator overnight (optional).
- On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. Brush with melted vegan butter and top with sugar and desired amount of cinnamon.
- Starting at one end, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough into 12 sections. Place on a 25 x 30cm baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.
- Brush with vegan butter (melted) and leave to rise again in a warm place until the size you want. Preheat oven to 175 C.
- Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown.
- Brush with sugar/water glaze as they come out of oven.
- Frost with a mixture of icing sugar and 1-2 Tbsp almond milk.

comments:
