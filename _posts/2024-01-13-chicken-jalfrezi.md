ingredients:	
- 0.5 cup oil or ghee
- 3 onions, chopped
- 1 whole bulb of garlic, minced
- Large chunk of ginger, minced
- 2-4 green chillis, whole
- 1 tsp tomato puree/concetrate (optional)
- 2 tsp salt, or to taste
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1.5 tsp crushed black pepper
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 0.5 tsp turmeric powder
- 3 tomatoes, chopped
- 800g chicken boneless, cut into bite-sized pieces, preferably thigh
- 3 capsicums, preferably different colours, diced into bite-sized pieces
- 5 tbsp white vinegar
- Fresh coriander, for garnish 
 
directions: 
- In a pan, add the oil/ghee. Add in the onions and fry on a medium-high heat, stirring regularly to ensure the onions brown evenly
- Once the onions are beginning to turn golden (between 10-15 minutes) add the garlic, ginger and green chillies. Fry this for a few minutes
- Add in the tomatoes. Turn the heat up to high and fry the mixture until most of the water dries out, the oil begins to separate and the mixture looks jammy
- Add the chicken pieces and all the spices. Fry these on high heat, stirring regularly to ensure the chicken does not burn and is coloured evenly. Continue to fry this for about 10 minutes
- Add about 1/3 cup of water, cover and allow the chicken to cook for about 20 minutes
- Add in the vinegar and the diced capsicum. Stir through, then turn the heat down to low and allow this to cook for between 5-10 minutes, covered with the lid. The capsicum should remain crunchy
- Finish off by stirring in some chopped coriander before serving.
