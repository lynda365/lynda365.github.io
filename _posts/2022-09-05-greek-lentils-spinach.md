tags: veggie vegan main

ingredients:
- 450g brown or large green lentils
- 2000ml vegetable broth or water (3 cubes)
- 1 jalapeño pepper chopped
- 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
- 2 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 450g sweet potatoes cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 250g baby spinach, chopped
- 450g butternut squash cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, with leaves, sliced
- 3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 teaspoons sea salt, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
- 80ml fresh lemon juice
- 2 lemons (zest of one)
- Feta cheese (optional)


directions:
- In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, combine the lentils, stock or water, jalapeño, coriander, cumin, oregano and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer, partially covered, about 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender.
- Add the potatoes, spinach and butternut squash, re-cover and cook another 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes and squash are tender.
- Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion, and cook, stirring, until it starts to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the celery and garlic and lemon zest and cook, stirring often, until they soften, 3 minutes. Add the mixture to the soup, deglazing the skillet with a little soup liquid and adding the deglaze contents back to the soup pot. Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper, taste, and add more if needed. Pick out and discard the bay leaves.
- Serve with lemon wedges and crumbled feta cheese
