ingredients:
- 2 Gressingham duck breasts 200-225g each

directions:
- Preheat your oven to 200°C / Fan 180°C / Gas Mark 6 and remove all packaging.
- Pat the skin of the duck breast with a kitchen towel to remove excess moisture. Score and season with salt and black pepper.
- Cook skin side down in a hot non-stick frying pan without oil. Cook for 5 minutes until the skin turns golden brown. Pour off excess fat regularly. Turn over and seal the meat for 1 minute. 
- Place the duck breasts skin side up on a baking tray in the middle of the preheated oven. Cook for 10-15 minutes, depending on how you like your duck cooked. Rare = 10 mins, medium = 15 mins, well done = 18 mins. Rest the meat in a warm place for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
