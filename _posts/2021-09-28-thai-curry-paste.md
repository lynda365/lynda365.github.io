title: "Thai Curry Paste"
tags: ingredient

ingredients:
- 200g lemon grass
- 200g fresh laos/galangal or 50g dried
- 150g chillis, green or red
- 20 garlic cloves
- 200g shallots
- bunch of fresh coriander
- 250ml water
- 1.5 tsp ground black pepper
- 1.5 tsp ground cumin
- 3 tsp ground coriander


directions:
- If using dried laos, grind this to a powder in the blender first and set aside.
- Chop/slice all the ingredients as small as reasonable. This is important with fresh laos and lemon grass, which are really tough.
- Blend everything together except for the powders. This may need to be done in batches. Start with the softer, wetter ingredients, then gradually add the tougher ones. Mix in the powders at the end.
- Divide into 5 plastic cups and tie into freezer bags. Freeze until needed.

comments: 
- Makes 5 x 200ml portions.
- You can add 5 tsp shrimp paste to this if not using for veggie/vegan dishes.
