The only way to use TAGS is to create the recipes as posts.
This means putting them in _posts directory and adding a date at the front in set format 2019-01-01-title.md
Can be any old date as it doesn't need to be shown
Need a TAGS page
A tweak to search.json to make it look at posts instead of recipes
Mostly everything else is the same
Can use the recipe template in _layouts as before
Edit in index.html to show posts instead of recipes
Edit in index.html to sort by title (instead of date)












Lots of css edits including
 
bass.css

Added padding to line 637 to adjust column spacing between ingredients and directions
 .sm-col {
    float: left;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    padding-right: 5%;
  }
