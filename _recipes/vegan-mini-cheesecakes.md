title:  "Vegan Mini Cheesecakes"
image: vegan-mini-cheesecakes.jpg
tags: vegan, dessert

ingredients:
- 240g digestive biscuits (check for vegan)
- 80g Stork margarine
- ---
- 180g raw cashews (quick-soaked)
- 50ml lemon juice
- 80g coconut oil, melted
- 150ml full-fat coconut milk (thick part after tin has been chilled)
- 120ml agave nectar or maple syrup or golden syrup (or honey if not vegan)
- ---
- blueberries or raspberries, fresh or frozen

directions:
- Crush or process biscuits to very fine crumbs. Melt margarine and mix together in a bowl.
- Grease and flour 2 x 12 cupcake trays. To make removing the cheesecakes easier, cut strips of parchment paper and lay them in the slots. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop out once frozen.
- Next scoop in heaped tablespoons of crust and press with fingers. To pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and really press it down. Set in freezer to firm up.
- Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. Add some more lemon juice or coconut liquid if required. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
- Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles, 
- If adding fruit, swirl on top.
- Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard - about 4-6 hours.
- To serve, briefly stand tray in shallow hot water in the sink. To remove, tug on the tabs or loosen with a butter knife. Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 weeks.
- You can set them out for 10 minutes before serving to soften, but I liked them frozen as well.

comments: 
- To quick-soak cashews, pour boiling hot water over the cashews, soak for 1 hour uncovered, then drain and use as instructed.
- Makes 24 in shallow cupcake trays, or 12 in muffin tray.
- Bases can also be made from 200g pitted dates and 120g walnuts, chopped.
